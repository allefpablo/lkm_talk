# Linux Kernel Development: Modules and Drivers

This repo contains examples of Linux Kernel Modules that I collected from many sources. The code samples, exercises and slides (in portuguese) are part of a introductory lecture. Most of the examples are extracted from:

* [The LKM Programming Guide](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/)
* [Exploring Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.com.br/Exploring-Raspberry-Pi-Interfacing-Embedded-ebook/dp/B01H2KNGX8)
